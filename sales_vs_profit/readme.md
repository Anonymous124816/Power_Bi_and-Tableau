# Kaggle Dataset Preprocessing for Tableau and Power BI

## Overview
This project involves the preprocessing of a dataset sourced from Kaggle for visualization in Tableau and Power BI. The dataset was subjected to some preprocessing steps using Pandas before being loaded into Tableau and Power BI for further analysis and visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle. It contains [describe your dataset here - e.g., information about sales, customer demographics, etc.]. The dataset can be found on Kaggle at [insert Kaggle dataset link].

## Preprocessing
Before loading the dataset into Tableau and Power BI, some preprocessing steps were performed using Pandas:
- Data cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, etc.
- Data transformation: Feature engineering, data normalization, etc.
- Data aggregation: Summarizing data at different levels, creating new features, etc.


## Note
- Ensure that you have the necessary software installed (Tableau, Power BI, Python with Pandas) before running the preprocessing script and visualizing the data.
- Customize the preprocessing script according to the specific requirements of your dataset and analysis.


## And any insights are welcomed !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
